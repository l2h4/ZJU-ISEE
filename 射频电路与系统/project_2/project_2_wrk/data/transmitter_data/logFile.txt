Warning detected by hpeesofsim in FCAC frequency selection during AC analysis `AC1'.
    A behavioral mixer has SideBand=BOTH.
    FCAC analysis requires a single sideband so SideBand=LOWER will be used.
    If results for both sidebands are desired,
    please consider an HB analysis instead of an FCAC analysis.
